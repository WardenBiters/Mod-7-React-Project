# Biting The Warden

Created by Engels G. and Kelly X.C.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, Biting The Warden is for anyone. It allows users to store account usernames and passwords for easier accessibility.

## API & React Router

This application will use the Bitwarden Vault Management API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: https://bitwarden.com/help/vault-management-api/
- API endpoint #1: Lock & Unlock
  - Description of endpoints:
    - `/lock`: creates a key when a session starts (`POST`)
    - `/unlock`: destroys the session key at the end (`POST`)
  - List of data values used by the endpoint:
    - 200: Success, and confirmation is returned
    - 400: Bad Request
    - 404: Not Found
    - 500: Internal Server Error
- API endpoint #2: Vault Items
  - Description of endpoint:
    - `/object/item`: add a new item (`POST`)
    - `/object/item/{id}`: edit an item (`PUT`)
    - `/object/item/{id}`: retrieve an item (`GET`)
    - `/object/item/{id}`: delete an item (`DELETE`)
    - `/list/object/items`: retrieve a list of items (`GET`)
  - List of data values used by the endpoint
    (Same for all of them)
    - 200: Success returns an object representing the edited item in the `"data":{} `property
      - For retrieving items: Success returns confirmation that the item was restored with `"data":[] `property
    - 400: Bad Request
    - 404: Not Found
    - 500: Internal Server Error
- API endpoint #3: Attachments & Fields - Username and Password
  - Description of endpoint:
    - `/object/username/{id}`: retrieving the username of the login item
    - `/object/password/{id}`: retrieving the password of the login item
  - List of data values used by the endpoint
    - 200: Success returns an object containing username/password of the item
    - 400: Bad Request
    - 404: Not Found
    - 500: Internal Server Error

Our API does **not** require a key.

**Example:**

- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
  - This will fetch an array of artwork objects
  - For each artwork, I want the `id`, `title`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/{id}
  - This will fetch a single artwork object
  - I will use the `id`, `title`, `short_description`, `medium_display`, `place_of_origin` and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={query}
  - This will fetch a list of artworks that relate to the search query
  - For each artwork, I will use the `id` and `title`

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

- On the `/` page, users can use the unlock button to open their vault.
- On the `/vault` page, users can see a list of the items in their vault.
- On the `/vault/:itemId` page, users can see and/or edit the specific item.

**Example:**

- On the `/artworks` page, users can view a grid of all artwork
- On the `/artworks` page, users can click on a piece of art in the grid, taking them to the details page for that piece of art.
- On the `/artworks/:artworkId` page, users can view additional details for a single piece of art
- On the `/` page, users can search for artwork titles related to a search term.

## ü§î Stretch User Stories

If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:

- Users will be able to add notes to items on their vault.
- Users will be able to make/edit folders in their vault.
- Users will be able to generate passwords for their items.

**Example:**

- Users will be able to save and view favorited artworks using local storage
- Users will be able to change the color scheme of the website from light mode to dark mode
